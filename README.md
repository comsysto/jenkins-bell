jenkins-bell
============

JenkinsBell is a groovy script to monitor the build result of certain jobs of multiple Jenkins instances.

There are multiple ways that a change in the state of a job can be announced:
* Use a text-to-speech tool to read the name of the job and the build result, The command that is used can be configured dependent on the OS.
* Open a message window
* Create report files that can be used in command line scripts or MacOS GeekTools.
  This reports are stored in the ~/.jenkins-bell/report folder

# Licences #
JenkinsBell is provided under the [Apache Licence Version 2](https://github.com/comsysto/jenkins-bell/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

JenkinsBell bundles a slightly modified version of the terminal-notifier (replaced icon and bundle name) which is provided,
like the original, under the [MIT licence](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier#license).
All credit for the terminal-notifier goes to the original version which can be downloaded from [github](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier).


# Install and Run#

## Install on MacOS ##

* install git (for example via home brew)

* install groovy (for example via home brew)

* clone the jenkins-bell repository with git

        git clone git://github.com/comsysto/jenkins-bell.git /Applications/JenkinsBell.app


## Run on MacOS as Application ##

* double click the application

* open the configuration window by selecting "Open Configuration" in the context menu of the dock icon


## Run on MacOS as LaunchAgent ##

* open the configuration window with the script

        /Applications/JenkinsBell.app/Contents/MacOS/configure.sh

* run the script to install JenkinsBell as MacOS LaunchAgent

        /Applications/JenkinsBell.app/Contents/MacOS/installLaunchAgent.sh



## Use on MacOS with geektools ##

* install geektools from [App Store](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/geektool/id456877552?mt=12)

* create a script geeklet by dragging the script element to the desktop

* enter the as script command for the geeklet

        cat ~/.jenkins-bell/report/overview

* configure a refresh interval of 60s

* create more geeklets by displaying the other files in the ~/.jenkins-bell/report directory



## Install on Linux ##

* install git (for example via apt-get)

* install groovy (for example via apt-get)

* clone the jenkins-bell repository with git

        git clone git://github.com/comsysto/jenkins-bell.git


## Run on Linux ##

* configure the app via

        $INSTALL_DIR/Contents/Linux/configure.sh

* start the application via

        $INSTALL_DIR/Contents/Linux/start.sh

* stop the application via

        $INSTALL_DIR/Contents/Linux/stop.sh


## Install as startup item on Ubuntu ##

* see this [howto](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/how-to-add-a-program-to-the-ubuntu-startup-list-after-login)

## Update JenkinsBell ##
In the majority of cases a simple git pull will work.

    cd /Applications/JenkinsBell.app
    git pull

On Mac OS X if the update includes a change to the _Info.plist_ file a reboot can be required because the OS might cache the file.

## Known Linux Issues ##

### 'Go to xxx' menu items doesn't work when clicked ###
When started via terminal, there is a message like "Desktop API not supported".
Try to install gnome libs:

    sudo apt-get install libgnome2-0

# Directory Layout #

The application creates a hidden directory in your user home folder with the name '.jenkins-bell'.
This directory has the following layout:

        .jenkins-bell
        ├── build-config.xml # this file contains the configured builds of JenkinsBell
        ├── user-config.xml  # this file contains the user specific settings of JenkinsBell
        ├── log             # this file contains summary of the configured builds and the last state changes
        ├── report          # in this directory a report of the current state of a job is located
        │   ├── Test
        │   └── overview   # this file contains a overview of the state of all configured builds
        └── state           # in this directory the last seen state of a job is persisted
            └── Test


# Extending JenkinsBell #
JenkinsBell uses some kind of micro kernel like infrastructure. In fact its a bunch of groovy script files so called _modules_ that can call method on each others.
The main feature of the kernel is, that a module that want to execute a function on another module have not not specify
the target module. Instead it calls a proxy object in the modules binding that routs the method call to a module that
defines a method with this signature. This lookup never throws a error if the called method is not defined in any module. If the called
method returns a result, this result is wrapped in a Option object (similar to the scala Option) which is used to signal if
a module was found which satisfy the call. Each call to another module should be aware that the called module could not be deployed.

     onAModule.createLogoImage(32).ifSome { image ->
     ...
     }

Another feature of the kernel is that a caller can not only invoke a method on one module, but on all modules that define a method with the requested signature,
any returned result will be collected in a list.
With this facility patterns like listener or white board can easily be archived.

    onEachModule.onStartMonitoring()

Different module setups can be bundled to a _command_. A _command_ can be specified as first argument for the start up scripts:

    ./run.sh myTestCommand

To deploy a new command you can add a text file with the ending _.command_ in the _~/.jenkins-bell/commands_ folder.
Each line of the file contains a module name or path to a module that should be used in the command.
If a line starts with a exclamation mark the rest of the line is used as a name of a method that is called after all modules are started.
The order of the lines determine the order in which the modules are scanned for defined methods and
the lines that specify method names are called in the order in which they appear in the file.

For example the file _/Applications/JenkinsBell.app/Contents/commands/monitor.command_ that defines the _monitor_ command, has the following content:

    !restartMonitoring
    UiBaseModule
    AgentModule
    ConfigModule
    ConfigWindowModule
    DockModule
    FilesModule
    LogModule
    MenuModule
    PopupModule
    ReportModule
    SpeechModule
    TrayModule
    JenkinsModule
    NotificationCenterModule

The central module of JenkinsBell is the AgentModule.groovy it runs the monitoring main loop and invokes the lifecycle notification methods.
A contributed module can participate in the lifecycle by defining some or all of the following methods:

    void onStartMonitoring() {
    }

    void onBeginPoll() {
    }

    void onBuildStateChanged(build){
    }

    void onEndPoll(){
    }

    void onStopMonitoring() {
    }

To access all current builds the module can call:

    Some<List> buildsOption = onAModule.getBuilds()
    List builds = buildsOption.toList()
    builds.each { build ->
        // do something ...
    }

To contribute a config file entry and a panel in the config window:

    void readConfigElement(slurpers, config){
       config.trayEnabled = (slurpers?.user?.trayEnabled?:"true").toBoolean()
    }

    void writeConfigElement(builders, config){
        builders.user.trayEnabled config.trayEnabled
    }

    Option<List<JPanel>> configElementPanel(config){
        Option.some([new SwingBuilder().panel(){
            borderLayout()
            label(text: "trayEnabled", constraints: BorderLayout.WEST)
            checkBox(selected: config.speechEnabled, actionPerformed: {e -> config.speechEnabled = e.source.selected})
        }])
    }

To contribute a new popup menu entry:

    @Field
    Option menuContribution

    @Field
    Map menu = ["My cool menu item": {-> println("Let's rock")}]

    menuContribution = onAModule.contributeToMenu(menu)

    void onSomeEvent(){
         // you can later update the menu via:
         menu["My new menu item"] = {-> println("hello world")}
         menuContribution.ifSome{ it.update() }
    }

    void onSomeOtherEvent(){
        // you can remove your contribution by calling
        menuContribution.ifSome{ it.remove() }
        menuContribution = Option.none()
    }
